"""File drops from Explorer onto Tk widgets.

tkdnd is not a dependency of this project, so on Windows the shell32 API is used
directly: DragAcceptFiles registers a window with the shell, and the shell answers
a drop with WM_DROPFILES, which a subclassed window procedure intercepts.

On any other platform `enable_file_drop` reports failure and callers keep using
their normal file picker.
